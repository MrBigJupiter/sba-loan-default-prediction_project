# SBA Loan Default Analysis and Prediction

This project analyzes and models loan default risk using a subset of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) loan dataset. The focus is on loans issued to businesses in the **Real Estate and Rental and Leasing** industry within **California**.

The dataset contains **2,102 observations** and **35 features**, including loan details, business characteristics, and a binary indicator for loan default.
